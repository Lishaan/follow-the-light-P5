# Follow the light

A game where the player follows the mouse location for movement to avoid obstacles and obtain score. The movement and steering algorithms are based on simple [Vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)) concepts and formulaes. The code is written using JavaScript along with the [p5.js JavaScript](https://p5js.org/) framework. Props to the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/) for this amazing framework!
